A friend of mine makes crossword puzzles, but doesn't provide a good way to solve them, so I made this app to help with that.

To build, use `./gradlew assemble`.
To build and run, use `./gradlew run`.

Mouse or arrow keys to navigate.
Space to insert a block.
Backspace to clear.
Any letter to insert that letter.
